Eight months in and your greatest hits were ‘forgot my wallet’ and ‘what’s your Netflix password?’ I’m retiring from carrying conversations, plans, and your sense of time. You treat effort like a limited edition drop and somehow never check out. I want chemistry, not customer service. So congrats: you’re free to ghost in peace, and I’m free to stop pretending that ‘busy’ is a personality. Keep the hoodies; I’m keeping my Saturdays.
